# How to Use The /button-make Command

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to be a host to use this command!
{% endhint %}

### Step 1 - Proper

First, you need to select yes or no for the proper. If you select Yes, then the bot will create a thread for you and a role. But if you select No, the bot will only send you a message (no role & threads were created).\
Only select "Yes" if you wish to host a game night longer or if there's more than one game.

### Step 2 - Type

In this step, you'll be asked about the type of game night. If you select "Roblox", you'll unlock the Roblox Game Night feature, such as the "Link to the ProNighters Lobby" button. If you select "Non-Roblox", it only sends you a message without a "Link to the ProNighters Lobby" button.

In this step, you can customize the embed message of your game night button.\
By default, the title, description, footer, and button text are already filled. You can customize them to anything you want.\
You only need the other info about the game night in the "GAME NIGHT LINK GOES HERE" field, which can be filled using a link or a message.

### Step 4 - Finalize
