### Step 1 - Specify how many days the user needs to be blacklisted.

When you first use the /blacklist-gamenight command, you'll be asked how long the user needs to be blacklisted (in days). For example, when you type 1, the user will be blacklisted for 1 day.

### Step 2 - Select the user to be blacklisted.

Select a user that you need to be blacklisted. You can select a user from the command or use a user ID. (Read the article [Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID) for more details about User ID)

### Step 3 - Specify a reason why the user is blacklisted.

You need the reason why the user is blacklisted from joining game nights. For example: "This user is breaking too many game night rules."
