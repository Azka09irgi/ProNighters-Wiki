If you can't do this, you must add the private server owner (aka the host) as one of your connections on Roblox, so that you can join their private servers.

### If you're on mobile or console

You can ask the hosts to add you as a connection on Roblox or add you as a private server member.\
NOTE: The host might reject your request to add you as their connection.

### Finalize

Finally, when you want to join a game night with a private server, you can enter the host's private server. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask our hosts!
